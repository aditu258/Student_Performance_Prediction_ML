## 🔥 Key Contributions  

### ✅ Data Ingestion & Preprocessing  
- Extracted student performance data from **MongoDB** and converted it into CSV format.  
- Handled missing values using **SimpleImputer** for numerical and categorical data.  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.  
- Split the dataset into **training and testing sets** for model evaluation.  

### ✅ Data Validation & Transformation  
- Applied **StandardScaler** for numerical features and **OneHotEncoder** for categorical variables.  
- Used **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test** to detect **data drift** between training and testing datasets.  
- Saved transformed data using **NumPy arrays** for optimized processing.  

### ✅ Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Implemented multiple regression models:  
  - **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Linear Regression**.  
- Optimized model performance using **Grid Search & Hyperparameter tuning**.  
- Achieved **high R² score (>0.85)** in predicting student scores.  
- Used **MLflow** for model tracking, experiment logging, and performance evaluation.  

### ✅ Model Tracking & Experimentation  
- Integrated **DagsHub** with **MLflow** for seamless version control, experiment tracking, and collaboration.  
- Logged **model parameters, evaluation metrics, and trained models** in MLflow.  
- Compared different models and stored the **best-performing model** for deployment.  

### ✅ Deployment & Cloud Integration  
- Designed an **automated ML pipeline** for data ingestion, validation, transformation, and model training.  
- Deployed the trained model using **Flask API** to serve predictions.  
- Packaged the model using **Docker** for deployment.  
- Synced trained models and artifacts to **AWS S3** for storage and real-time updates.
